(Page 1: Defining Invertebrates & Exoskeletons - Challenge)
Content:
Scientists group animals. One very large group is invertebrates. The main feature of an invertebrate is that it does not have a backbone 🚫🦴 (also called a vertebral column). Think about your own backbone! Invertebrates don't have one. Many invertebrates have an exoskeleton, which is a hard outer covering, like armor 💪, that supports and protects their body. Did you know? 😮 Over 95% of all known animal species are invertebrates!
Quiz Questions: ❓
What is the main thing invertebrates DON'T have? (Options: Legs / ✅ A backbone / Eyes)
What is the hard outer covering that protects many invertebrates called? (Options: Skin / ✅ Exoskeleton / Fur)
Are invertebrates common or rare? (Options: ✅ Very common / Very rare / Only in zoos)

(Page 2: Introducing Insects 🦋 - Challenge)
Content:
Insects 🐜 are a major group of invertebrates, meaning they lack a backbone 🚫🦴 and often have an exoskeleton 💪. They are cold-blooded 🥶. This means their internal body temperature changes depending on the outside environment. Insects reproduce by laying eggs 🥚. The word for egg-laying is oviparous.
Quiz Questions: ❓
What does 'oviparous' mean? (Options: ✅ Lays eggs / No backbone / Is cold-blooded)

Which is NOT a characteristic of insects mentioned here? (Options: Having an exoskeleton / Being cold-blooded / ✅ Having a backbone)

(Page 3: Insect Anatomy: Three Segments - Challenge)
Content:
An insect's body is divided into three main sections (segments).
Head: Contains sensors like eyes 👀 and antennae 👋, plus mouthparts for feeding 👄. Used for sensing the world.
Thorax: The central section where the legs 🦵 and (if present) wings connect. Important for movement 🏃‍♀️.
Abdomen: The rear section containing organs for digestion 😋, breathing 😮‍💨, and making eggs 🥚.
Quiz Questions: ❓

We learned about animals without backbones 🚫🦴. Now let's learn about other kinds of living things that are very, very small! 🔬

(Page 15: Introducing Microorganisms 🔬🦠 - Challenge)
Content:
Microorganisms 🦠 are living things that are tiny! Humans need to use a special tool called a microscope 🔬 to see most of them. They live almost everywhere on Earth 🌍! Many microorganisms are made of only one single cell (unicellular). A cell is the smallest unit of life ✨.

Most reproduce by splitting into two ✌️ (binary fission). Bacteria can live in many different places, including harsh environments 🔥💧 like hot springs, as well as soil, water, and inside other living things (like us!). Because they have no backbone 🚫🦴, they are technically invertebrates, but usually studied separately due to being microorganisms.

We learned about tiny living bacteria 🦠. But what about viruses 🦠? 🤔

(Page 18: Bonus: What About Viruses? 🦠 - Challenge)
Content:
Viruses 🦠 are even smaller than bacteria! Scientists debate if they are truly 'alive' 🤔 because they cannot reproduce on their own. Viruses need to get inside a living cell (a host cell 🏠) to make copies of themselves (replicate ➡️👥). They take over the host cell to make more viruses. Viruses often cause sicknesses 🤒, like the cold or the flu.
Optional Check Questions (Not Scored): ❓
What does a virus 🦠 need to make copies of itself? (Options: Water / Sunlight / ✅ A host cell)
Are viruses considered fully living organisms by all scientists? (Options: Yes / ✅ No, because they need a host to reproduce / Yes, because they cause disease)
